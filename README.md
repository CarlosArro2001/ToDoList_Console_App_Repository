# ToDoList_Console_App_Repository
 
### About Project
This is a simple to do list application which uses CSV as it's storage
This took about a week to do since this is just a pet project
### Known bugs 
* When deleting all the tasks and returning back to the main menu , main menu would display the last task that was deleted even though the TaskList.csv is empty
